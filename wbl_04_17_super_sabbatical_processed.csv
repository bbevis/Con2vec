We did get closer to a deal as I overhauled my portfolio at $450,000 and dropped down to $350,000 by the end while trying to secure more months.",7,7,6,7,7,"Opening Bid:
I plan to open with a request for £450,000. This gives me some flexibility to make concessions while still having a good chance of reaching my target. 

Outside Options:
If I'm unable to reach a deal with the Provost, my next best option is to pursue the private investor offers. One group has intimated a deal that could yield £400,000, which would meet my needs. However, this path involves more uncertainty and a longer timeline, jeopardizing my ability to start my sabbatical promptly.

My fallback, if both the Provost and private deals fall through, would be to take a smaller sabbatical - perhaps 6 months instead of a year before the Institute. I could finance this with my boat down payment and by taking on some debt. But this is far from ideal, as it wouldn't provide the full respite I need and would leave me in a weaker financial position.

Knowing my outside options helps clarify that reaching a deal with the Provost is very much my preferred path. It provides the surest and quickest route to achieving my sabbatical goals and maintaining my long-term success and well-being. However, I'm not without alternatives, which gives me some leverage in the negotiation.

My strategy will be to anchor high with my opening bid, emphasizing the unique value of my IP and my strong market position. I'll then look to make concessions as needed to reach my target price or as close to it as possible. Throughout, I'll stress my desire to reach a mutually beneficial deal that supports my ongoing contributions to the university.

I feel confident and well-prepared to achieve a good outcome that will allow me to recharge and return to my groundbreaking work in a sustainable way. The Provost should see the merit in this investment in a highly productive asset.","400,000",Star Scientist
