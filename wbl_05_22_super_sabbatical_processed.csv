This is reasonable, as a colleague at this same university sold his portfolio to a private company for the same price, though his patents were far less useful than mine. 

I believe in the importance of science and academia, which is why I would prefer to sell my portfolio to the university. However, if the university refuses my offer, I am not unopposed to selling my portfolio to a private company, which would not only offer a higher payment but better wages. The university should be aware that I am one of the top scholars in the world for this field, but after years of hard work, I am getting burnt out. I want to stay creatively viable and for that, need to take this break so I can return with energy to continue my work. If this is not made available for me, the working conditions at this university will not allow me to work here any further, and I will pursue the many offers that I have from other top-tier universities.
